## Karabiner Elements JSON configuration file.
[Karabiner Elements] is one of the most known pieces of software for keyboard personalization and remapping on macOS. Althoug everyone may have different uses for it, these are some of the functionalities I get from it and on this repo I'd be sharing my JSON configuration file.

### ðŸŽ› Functionalities included on the config file:
- Double L-Shift to Caps Lock.
- Change Caps_Lock to Control + Option + Command.
- Change R_Command to Hyper key.
- Change R_Option to FN.
- Quit application by pressing Command + Q twice.
- Double tab and hold L_Command to become L_Control. (Usefull to navigate throug tabs with CMD + TAB)
- Tab Launcher. (Used to launch/focus on a specific app by pressing TAB + KEY)
