## Karabiner Elements JSON configuration file.
[Karabiner Elements] is one of the most known pieces of software for keyboard personalization and remapping on macOS. Althoug everyone may have different uses for it, these are some of the functionalities I get from it and on this repo I'd be sharing my JSON configuration file.

### ðŸŽ› Functionalities included on the config file:
- Remap CAPS LOCK to Hyper layer when hold or backspace when pressed.
- Remap RETURN to system layer when hold.
- Remap LEFT SHIFT double press to CAPS LOCK.
- Remap RIGHT OPTION to FN.
- Modify quitting applications by pressing COMMAND + Q twice.
- Spacebar Launcher Layer. (Used to launch/focus on a specific app by pressing SPACEBAR + KEY)
